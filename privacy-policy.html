        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: November 27, 2024</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Lunar Calendar ("we," "our," or "the app"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Lunar Calendar mobile application.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Lunar Calendar is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect any personal identification information</li>
            <li>We do not track your location</li>
            <li>We do not access your contacts</li>
            <li>We do not require any account registration</li>
            <li>We do not use analytics or tracking services</li>
            <li>We do not display advertisements</li>
            <li>We do not share any data with third parties</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All data created within the app (such as reminders, notes, and preferences) is stored locally on your device only. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reminders and Events:</strong> Stored locally on your device</li>
            <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Theme settings, language preferences, and calendar system choices</li>
            <li><strong>Recurring Items:</strong> Stored in local database on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties. If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be permanently deleted.
        </p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The app may request the following permissions solely for functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send you reminder alerts (optional, can be denied)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These permissions are only used for the stated purposes and do not involve any data collection or transmission.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our app is suitable for all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, there are no special provisions for children's data. Parents can feel secure knowing that their children's privacy is protected when using our app.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally on your device and we do not collect or transmit any information, your data security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using device lock screens and passwords</li>
            <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
            <li>Being cautious about who has physical access to your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no personal information for you to access, modify, or delete from our servers. All your app data is under your complete control on your own device.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Our app does not integrate with any third-party services, social media platforms, or external APIs. The app functions completely offline once downloaded.
